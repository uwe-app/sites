## Sites

Collection of websites using a workspace so we have a unified build.

* [website][]: Primary website for the UWE project.
* [blog][]: Blog for the UWE project.

To build the sites first install the UWE tools then clone this repository recursively:

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/uwe-app/sites
```

Then you can compile all the websites with the command:

```
uwe build
```
